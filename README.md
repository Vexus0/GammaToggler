# Gamma Toggler

Gamma Toggler is a lightweight, easy to use program that will toggle your display's gamma between the default value (1.0) and another custom value that you can set.

The inspiration for this project comes from games such as Rust and Foxhole which have extremely dark night-time visuals. Players who adjust their gamma settings achieve a significant advantage over players who do not, resulting in unfair gameplay. 

To compound the problem, changing gamma tends to be cumbersome for most users when using existing options like the NVIDIA control panel, AutoIt, or RivaTuner to achieve the same results. Gamma Toggler runs in your system tray and binds a single, user-defined hotkey (default: F10), as well as setting a user-defined gamma value (default: 2.8), to enable you to switch between gamma values at the press of a key.
